Cryptographic Hash 


Also known as:
- Digital fingerprint
- Cryptographic checksum
- Message digest


Definition:
- A cryptographic technique that creates a unique representation of a larger set of data 
- A mathematical function that supercompresses messages


Key properties:
- Convert variable length into fixed length
- One-wayness (i.e., irreversible; cannot "un-hash"; given hash value, cannot reconstruct original text/message/file)
- Collision avoidance (i.e., two different texts/messages/files should not result in the same hash result)
- Slightest of change to the original text/message/file results in a unique, uncorrelated hash value
- Deterministic (i.e., the same, unlatered text/message/file always results in the same hash value)


Uses:
- Digital signature(s)
- Obfuscate password(s) in storage (e.g., Windows Security Account Manager [SAM])
- Confirm file(s) unaltered in transit
- Rainbow tables (nefarious)


Example algorithms:
- MD family (e.g., MD5)
- SHA family (e.g., SHA-1, SHA-256)
- HAVAL
- RIPEMD family (e.g., RIPEMD-128, RIPEMD-160)
- Plus many more


Windows command:
certutil -hashfile <file name> MD5


macOS command:
md5 <file name>
